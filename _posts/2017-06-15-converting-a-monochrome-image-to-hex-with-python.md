Today at work one of my co-workers asked me if I could write a simple script that would take in a monochrome image and output the image data in 8-bit hex. 

He recently purchased a 128x64 OLED Display similar to [this one](link to adafruit website) and wanted to change the inital splash screen when you boot up the screen.

I said I'd take a stab at it. Little did I know Adafruit had already written a simple little app to do just that. Despite this being nothing more than a simple thought expirement in the end it was a fun little task. Here's what I came up with.
