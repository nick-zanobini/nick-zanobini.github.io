## About Me

Hi I'm Nick Zanobini. Thanks for visiting!  

I'm a Controls Engineer, Robotics Enthusiast, Equipment Designer and Python Developer.

I completed my undergrad (2012 - 2016) in [Electrical Engineering with an Emphasis in Computer Engineering](http://cse.lmu.edu/department/electricalengineeringandcomputerscience/)  and played [Water Polo](http://www.lmulions.com/sports/m-wpolo/loyo-m-wpolo-body.html) at [Loyola Marymount University](http://www.lmu.edu/).

Currently I am working at [Boston Scientific Neuromodulation](http://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/about-us/core-businesses/neuromodulation.html) on the Equipment Engineering team, developing new automated solutions for manufacturing medical devices.

I love building robots and I am always working on two or three projects on the nights and weekends. My goal is as to document them here as I bring them to some temporary form of completion.  

Feel free to reach out to me to see what I'm working on, or possibly discuss any revolutionary ideas.

On this site you can check out my [side projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) and the [thoughts/tips]({{ site.url }}/blog) I've had along the way.  

I am [nick-zanobini](https://github.com/nick-zanobini) on GitHub. You can see my full CV on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickzanobini) or you can [download]({{ site.url }}/assets/Nick's Résumé.pdf) it directly.

When I'm not building robots and automating everything I love to travel, explore, snowboard, hike, swim, and be outside.
