## About Me - Update 21

Hi I'm Nick Zanobini. Thanks for visiting!  

I'm an engineer by training and an inventor / roboticist by passion.  

I completed my undergrad (2012 - 2016) in [Electrical Engineering with an Emphasis in Computer Engineering](http://cse.lmu.edu/department/electricalengineeringandcomputerscience/)  and played [Water Polo](http://www.lmulions.com/sports/m-wpolo/loyo-m-wpolo-body.html) at [Loyola Marymount University](http://www.lmu.edu/).

<!-- For my capstone project my partner and I developed a Gesture Recognition Controlled Robotic Manipulator. Utilizing the built in strengths of MATLAB we developed a system that utilized a self trained cascade object detector and image processing in order control a 6 DOF robotic arm. -->

Currently I am working at [Boston Scientific Neuromodulation](http://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/about-us/core-businesses/neuromodulation.html) on the Equipment Engineering team, developing new automated solutions for manufacturing medical devices.

<!-- My interests are understanding how the human body functions and replicating it using sensors and robotic manipulators. This leads to my two fundamental desires: to develop a deeper understanding of the evolution of intelligence and to provide innovative solutions to improve the quality of life for all.
 -->
I am always working on two or three projects on the nights and weekends. My goal is as to document them here as I bring them to some temporary form of completion.  

On this site you can check out my [side projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) and the [thoughts/tips]({{ site.url }}/blog) I've had along the way.  

I am [nick-zanobini](https://github.com/nick-zanobini) on GitHub. You can see my full CV on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickzanobini) or you can [download]({{ site.url }}/assets/Nick's Résumé.pdf) it directly.

I love to travel, explore, snowboard, hike, swim, and be outside. In my spare time I tinker with electronics, write code and build robots.
