## About Me - Update 9

Hi I'm Nick Zanobini. Thanks for visiting!  

I'm an engineer by training and an inventor / roboticist by passion.  

After getting my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and playing Division 1 Water Polo at LMU, I took a job at Boston Scientific Neuromodulation as an Equipment Engineer, where I am today.  

I am always working on two or three projects on the nights and weekends. My goal is as to document them here as I bring them to some temporary form of completion.  

On this site you can check out my [side projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) and the [thoughts/tips]({{ site.url }}/blog) I've had along the way.  

I am [nick-zanobini](https://github.com/nick-zanobini) on GitHub. You can see my full CV on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickzanobini) or you can [download]({{ site.url }}/assets/Nick's Résumé.pdf) it directly.
