## About Me - Update 19

Hi I'm Nick Zanobini. Thanks for visiting!  

I'm an engineer by training and an inventor / roboticist by passion.  

I completed my undergrad (2012 - 2016) in [Electrical Engineering with an Emphasis in Computer Engineering](http://cse.lmu.edu/department/electricalengineeringandcomputerscience/)  and played [Water Polo](http://www.lmulions.com/sports/m-wpolo/loyo-m-wpolo-body.html) at [Loyola Marymount University](http://www.lmu.edu/).

 I took a job at Boston Scientific Neuromodulation as an Equipment Engineer, where I am today.  

I am always working on two or three projects on the nights and weekends. My goal is as to document them here as I bring them to some temporary form of completion.  

On this site you can check out my [side projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) and the [thoughts/tips]({{ site.url }}/blog) I've had along the way.  

I am [nick-zanobini](https://github.com/nick-zanobini) on GitHub. You can see my full CV on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickzanobini) or you can [download]({{ site.url }}/assets/Nick's Résumé.pdf) it directly.

For my capstone project my partner and I developed a Gesture Recognition Controlled Robotic Manipulator. Utilizing the built in strengths of MATLAB we developed a system that utilized a self trained cascade object detector and image processing in order control a 6 DOF robotic arm.

Currently I am working at [Boston Scientific Neuromodulation](http://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/about-us/core-businesses/neuromodulation.html) on the Equipment Engineering team, developing new automated solutions for manufacturing medical devices.

My interests are understanding how the human body functions and replicating it using sensors and robotic manipulators. This leads to my two fundamental desires: to develop a deeper understanding of the evolution of intelligence and to provide innovative solutions to improve the quality of life for all.

I love to travel, explore, snowboard, hike, swim, and be outside. In my spare time I tinker with electronics and write python scripts that make my life easier.
