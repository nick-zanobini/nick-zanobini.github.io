Unfortunately, my plugin is not in the list returned by "rqt --list-plugins". rosrun also fails.

```
cd ~/rqt_ws/

catkin_make

rosrun rqt_mypkg rqt_mypkg

qt_gui_main() found no plugin matching "rqt_mypkg"
```

Appears to be a problem with rqt caching the locations of plugins in its config and not updating that info. A workaround that works for me is delete that cache and restart rqt:

```
rm ~/.config/ros.org/rqt_gui.ini
rqt
```
