I bought a <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/p/PhantomX-Pincher-Robot-Arm.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trossen Robotics PhantomX Pincher Arm</a> recently and wanted to build a vision based pick and place system to get better with OpenCV and Python.

The first step was to get it setup and talking with my RPi.

Please see my <a href="https://nickzanobini.wordpress.com/2016/11/05/connecting-trossen-robotics-phantomx-pincher-arm-to-a-raspberry-pi/">blog post</a> on how to do this.

Once it was connected I needed to setup my Raspberry Pi to run OpenCV and Python3.

Details on how to this can be found <a href="https://nickzanobini.wordpress.com/2017/02/24/installing-opencv-and-pyqt5-on-raspberry-pi/">here</a>.
