If you ever wondered how to get a requirements.txt from a folder containing Python files, there's an easy solution.
[code language="bash" light="true"]
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs path_to_python_project
[/code]
There you go. You will have a requirements.txt that will encompass the files in your folder.
