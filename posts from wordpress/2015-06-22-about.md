<h1 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h1>
I completed my undergrad (2012 - 2016) in <a href="http://cse.lmu.edu/department/electricalengineeringandcomputerscience/">Electrical Engineering with an Emphasis in Computer Engineering</a>  and played <a href="http://www.lmulions.com/sports/m-wpolo/loyo-m-wpolo-body.html">Water Polo</a> at <a href="http://www.lmu.edu/">Loyola Marymount University</a>. My capstone project a Gesture Recognition Controlled Robotic Manipulator. My partner and I designed and created a MATLAB system that used utilized a self trained machine learning algorithm and image processing in order control a 6 DOF robotic arm.

Currently I am working at <a href="http://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/about-us/core-businesses/neuromodulation.html">Boston Scientific Neuromodulation</a> on the Equipment Engineering team, developing new automated solutions for manufacturing medical devices.

My interests are understanding how the human body functions and replicating it using sensors and robotic manipulators. This leads to my two fundamental desires: to develop a deeper understanding of the evolution of intelligence and to provide innovative solutions to improve the quality of life for all.

I love to travel, explore, snowboard, hike, swim, and be outside. In my spare time I tinker with electronics and write python scripts that make my life easier.
