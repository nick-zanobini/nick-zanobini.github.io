<p>Hi I&#39;m Nick Zanobini. Thanks for visiting!</p>

<p>I&#39;m an engineer by training and an inventor / roboticist by passion.</p>

<p>After getting my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and playing Division 1 Water Polo, I took a job at Boston Scientific Neuromodulation as an Equipment Engineer, where I am today.</p>

<p>I am always working on two or three projects on the nights and weekends. My goal is as to document them here as I bring them to some temporary form of completion.</p>

<p>On this site you can check out my <a href="projects/">side projects</a> and the <a href="blog/">thoughts/tips</a> I&#39;ve had along the way.</p>
