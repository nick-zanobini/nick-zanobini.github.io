<p>Hi I&#39;m Nick Zanobini. Thanks for visiting!</p>

<p>I&#39;m an engineer by training and an inventor / roboticist by passion.</p>

<p>After getting my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and playing Division 1 Water Polo, I took a job at Boston Scientific Neuromodulation as an Equipment Engineer, where I am today.</p>
