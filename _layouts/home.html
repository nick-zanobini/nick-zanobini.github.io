<p>Hi I&#39;m Nick Zanobini. Thanks for visiting!</p>

<p>I&#39;m an engineer by training and an inventor / roboticist by passion.</p>

<p>After getting my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and playing Division 1 Water Polo, I took a job at Boston Scientific as an Equipment Engineer, where I am today.</p>

<p>I am always working on two or three projects on the nights and weekends. My goal is as I bring them to some temporary form of completion that I will add them here.</p>

<p>One day, all of my past selves will unite to form <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZv5Z2Iz_s">Voltron</a>.</p>

<p>On this site you can check out my <a href="projects/">side projects</a> and the <a href="blog/">thoughts/tips</a> I&#39;ve had along the way.</p>

<p>I am <a href="https://github.com/nick-zanobini">nick-zanobini</a> on GitHub. You can find my full CV on my
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickzanobini">LinkedIn</a> page.</p>
